## Placing Items in a ItemCollection.

* An Item has a title (and an image, but that's behond the scope of this test)
* An ItemCollection  has a title and a description.
* An Item can belong to multiple ItemCollections.

## Functionality needed:

* Create the scaffold for `Item` and `ItemCollection`
* Add `Items` to more then 1 `ItemCollection`. 
* List the `Items` on the `ItemCollection`.
* Be able to sort the `Items` within the `ItemCollection`
* Please add the proper feature specs unit tests (if needed) for the models.

The libraries that we use are rspec and capybara.

## Workflow:

1. Checkout the project.
2. Create a local feature branch to do your work in
3. Commit local changes often
4. Push the local feature branch to the repository
5. When done submit a pull request and if needed add aditional comments on the pull request.
6. Please create the most simple solution that works and prove it by writing the correct specs.
